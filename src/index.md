# Innovation Ecosystem Monitor
</div>

## Mapping Switzerland's Innovation Strengths, Weaknesses and Their Evolution Over Time
### What is the monitors purpose?

The goal of this monitor is to provide an overview of the competitiveness of Switzerland's innovation ecosystem in an international context and go into more detail where it is relevant to Innosuisse. The monitor aims to provide a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the Swiss innovation ecosystem and its development over time. Wherever possible the monitor links to reports that describe the findings in more detail. The report is updated at least once a year after the publication of most indices in autumn.

### From the abstract to the concrete

Switzerland regularly appears on top of international innovation rankings. These indices are constructed out of a multitude of indicators, they present different perspectives on the innovation ecosystem and their selection influences the final ranking.

In the following, the report will first take a bird's eye view and look at different innovation indices (see below ‚Üì) and then will dive into detail and shed light on selected environment and framework conditions (menu on the left hand side¬†‚Üê). The starting point for the in-depth analyses are selected indicators from the European Innovation Scoreboard (EIS).

<div class="note" label="Note">
This is a new version of a previously internal Innovation Ecosystem Monitor published in Q3/2024. Differences in the findings or more recent sources compared to this version are highlighted in light blue like this: &nbsp;&nbsp;<mark>New</mark>&nbsp;&nbsp;. There have been major updates to the R&D, the innovation activities and the start-up chapter and only minor updates to this introductory and the knowledge transfer chapter.

## Switzerland maintains its position on top

${colorLegend("CHE")}'s top position in the two most prominent international innovation rankings is stable. Generally, there is not a lot of movement among the top 10 countries in both the Global Innovation Index (GII) and the European Innovation Scoreboard (EIS). Only ${colorLegend("SWE")}, ${colorLegend("KOR")} and ${colorLegend("CHN")} have made significant progress in both rankings. ${colorLegend("CHN")} has entered for the first time into the top 10 of the GII and is very close in the EIS.

display(plot_rank_bump(df_ranking, ["EIS", "GII"], true, html`Sources: WIPO (2024), European Commission (2025)`))
// display(plot_rank(df_ranking, domain_rank_gii, ["EIS", "GII", "EIQ"],"Sources: WIPO (2024), European Commission (2024) & Economist Impact (2023)", true))

<div class="note" label="FAQ">
  <details>
  <summary>Why are the Swiss S&T clusters not top-ranked?</summary>
  <p>Here, only Zurich region (rank 50, -1 compared to 2023) and Basel region (rank 96, +1 compared to 2023) rank among the <a href="https://www.wipo.int/web/global-innovation-index/2024/science-technology-clusters">top 100 Science & Technology-Clusters</a>, behind among others Paris (12), London (21), Munich (22), Stuttgart (29). 
  
  The reason why Switzerland appears nonetheless at the top of the rankings as a country is twofold: 
  1. The S&T-Clusters are - unlike the countries - not compared relative to their size, but in absolute terms. Consequently bigger clusters have an advantage.
  2. The concentration of S&T-Clusters in Switzerland is very high in relation to the rest of the country (and in contrast to other countries).</p></details></div>

Its closest competitors in the European Innovation Scoreboard ‚Äì ${colorLegend("SWE")}, ${colorLegend("KOR")} and ${colorLegend("DNK")} ‚Äì have made up substantial ground and are closing the gap. ${colorLegend("CHE")} on the other hand has lost ground in the last 7 years. [Reason: Modified EIS]

### Switzerland's strengths and weaknesses

The European Innovation Scoreboard (EIS) highlights Switzerland's greatest strengths in innovation as its universities' research output and the international composition of their student bodies / academic staff. Switzerland has recently shown significant progress in two crucial areas: venture capital availability and product innovation by SMEs. Notably, the long-declining trend in SME product innovation has reversed, showing positive momentum.

## Switzerland is one of the most competitive countries
